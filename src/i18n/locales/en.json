They solved a real problem: allowing divers to safely track bottom time using the rotating bezel. Before dive computers became ubiquitous in the 80s-90s, a dive watch was essential safety equipment.",

Their tool heritage, versatile styling, and robust build quality make them ideal daily wearers.

          "intro": "The quartz movement is often dismissed by purists, but it represents one of the most important innovations in watchmaking history. When Seiko launched the Astron in 1969, the first commercial quartz watch, it changed everything. Mechanical watches that drifted 5-10 seconds per day were suddenly less accurate than inexpensive quartz watches that drifted 15 seconds per month. The 'Quartz Crisis' nearly destroyed Swiss watchmaking in the 70s-80s. Today, quartz and mechanical coexist: quartz dominates global production, while mechanicals maintain prestige among collectors. Both have their place.",

          "intro": "The automatic movement (also called 'self-winding') is the ultimate expression of convenient mechanical watchmaking. Invented by Abraham-Louis Perrelet in 1770 but perfected in the 20th century, the automatic mechanism uses your wrist's natural motion to wind the mainspring. You wear the watch, the rotor spins, the watch stays wound. It's the elegant solution to 'I forgot to wind my watch' while maintaining all the mechanical craftsmanship collectors love. Automatics represent approximately 90% of modern mechanical watches - from entry-level Seiko 5 to Rolex, Omega, and Patek Philippe.",

The IWC Big Pilot (Große Fliegeruhr) was developed for the Luftwaffe. The American A-11 became standard for Allied pilots. After the war, these military watches inspired civilian designs. The IWC Mark series, Breitling Navitimer with its slide rule, and the Zenith Pilot Type 20 all capture the golden age of aviation watches. Today, pilot watches are celebrated by both collectors and actual pilots, though modern avionics have largely replaced watches for navigation."

Manufacturers soon created wristwatches designed specifically for military use. During WWII, the U.S. military standardized specifications for field watches (known as 'ord' watches after the Ordnance Department that specified them). Brands like Hamilton, Bulova, Elgin, and Waltham produced millions. The postwar MIL-W-46374 specification established standards for U.S. military watches: legibility at 12 inches in total darkness, durable construction, and water resistance. These vintage military watches inspired modern civilian designs. Today, brands like Hamilton continue the tradition with field watches that honor that utilitarian heritage while serving as excellent daily watches for civilians."

LEDs were replaced by LCD displays in the 70s, making digitals affordable. The Casio F-91W (1989) became one of the best-selling watches in history - still produced today at $10-20. The real game-changer came in 1983 when Casio launched the G-Shock DW-5000C. Designer Kikuo Ibe wanted to create a watch that would never break. After testing over 200 prototypes, he achieved shock resistance using modular construction and dual-layer case design. The G-Shock became legendary among military, emergency personnel, and anyone needing extreme durability. In 2015, Apple redefined the watch space with the Apple Watch, merging smartphone technology with wrist format. Today, smartwatches dominate global watch sales, though mechanicals maintain prestige and romance."

Popular models: DW-5600 (the classic 'square'), GA-2100 (the slim 'CasiOak'), Mudmaster, Rangeman, Frogman. G-Shocks range from $50 to $5,000+ for limited edition collaborations.
